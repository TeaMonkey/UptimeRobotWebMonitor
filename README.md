# UptimeRobotWebMonitor

This is a way for me to:

a) Learn golang (yes I know the code is not brilliant at the minute, but hopefully it will improve as I do)
b) Get something practical out of it, namely a interface to show all my Uptime Robot monitors in a nice and pretty manor

Todo (in no particular order)

a) Better error handling
b) Get monitors for Uptime Robot an display on a page (summary)
c) Click on each monitor and get more details
d) Better go code!
e) Cache the Templates
f) Get nice and valid HTML and CSS
g) Add a handler to go to a home page (With Uptime Robot summary display)
h) Add in a basic navigation
i) Anything else I can think of....
